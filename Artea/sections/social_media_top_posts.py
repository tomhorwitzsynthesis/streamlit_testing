### üìå Key Takeaways

**Facebook = spectacle + urgency**  
Contests, sports, and fraud alerts drive the highest engagement. Banks that tailor their content to excitement, national pride, and urgent warnings outperform those using purely educational or product-driven posts.

**LinkedIn = identity + credibility**  
Culture, rebrands, leadership, and values-focused posts resonate most. Banks succeed by humanizing themselves and sharing internal recognition, while hard business insights attract a narrower audience.

### üìä Facebook Content Summary
                
#### Content of the top 5 posts for each bank

**Citadele & Swedbank**
- Contests and giveaways dominate (ticket draws, prizes, sports tie-ins).
- Sports sponsorships (basketball in particular) provide a strong emotional hook.
- Posts lean into excitement, emojis, and a celebratory tone.

**SEB & Artea**
- Fraud/security alerts attract high interaction ‚Äî practical, widely relevant, and shareable.
- Surveys or data points on consumer behavior also spark interest when made relatable.

**Luminor**
- Attempts at engagement through webinars, financial education, or lifestyle tie-ins perform more modestly.
- The themes are useful but lack the immediate emotional payoff of contests or security alerts.

**Overall:**
- High-arousal content works best: competitions, national pride, and urgent warnings.
- Purely educational or product-driven posts struggle unless wrapped in lifestyle relevance.

**Cross-Bank Themes**
- Entertainment, urgency, and fun win.
- Contests and sports are the universal currency.
- Fraud/security alerts are the only serious theme that reliably breaks through.

### üìä LinkedIn Content Summary
                        
#### Content of the top 5 posts for each bank

**SEB & Swedbank**
- Employee culture and recognition posts (team events, awards, new hires) resonate strongly.
- Leadership and organizational changes (e.g., CEO announcements) also generate traction.
- These banks lean on LinkedIn as a brand/culture stage.

**Artea**
- Rebranding and identity-building is a winning theme ‚Äî novelty and narrative matter.
- Values-based posts (e.g., solidarity with Ukraine) also gain visibility.

**Citadele**
- Focuses on thought-leadership (economic outlook, AI, leadership trends).
- While more niche in reach, it positions the brand as serious and analytical.

**Luminor**
- Engagement comes from light office culture and CSR/entrepreneurship programs.
- More human, but less differentiated compared to SEB/Swedbank.

**Overall:**
- Culture and identity posts dominate (internal recognition, rebrands, value-driven messages).
- Thought-leadership works, but it attracts a narrower, more specialized audience.

**Cross-Bank Themes**
- Banks succeed by humanizing themselves ‚Äî employees, culture, values, brand identity.
- Hard business insights (Citadele‚Äôs angle) stand out as distinctive, but they do not maximize broad engagement.

**Key Takeaway**
- **LinkedIn = identity + credibility** (culture, rebrands, leadership, values).
- Banks that tailor their content to the emotional logic of LinkedIn outperform those trying to force one style across both.
